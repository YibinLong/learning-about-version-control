# Learning about Version Control

Solving merge conflicts takes conscious effort, but I can do it!

What I like most about version control:
The fact that you can go back to any previous commit, and to see the state of the repository at that commit.

Most challenging/confusing/frustrating about version control:
When you're on a branch, and you become more ahead of the main branch with your personal additions, but behind of the main branch because of other people's contributions. This makes it difficult to resolve merge conflicts when merging back to the main branch.
